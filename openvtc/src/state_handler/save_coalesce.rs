//! Coalesced, off-runtime `Config` persistence (R11).
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! [`openvtc_core::config::Config::save`] is fully synchronous and expensive:
//! per call it clones the protected tier, serializes + AES-GCM encrypts both the
//! public/protected and secured tiers, writes + `chmod`s files, performs an OS
//! **keyring** `Entry::set_secret` syscall, and — on token-protected profiles —
//! blocking **PC/SC smart-card** I/O. Before R11 every config-mutating site
//! called it inline on the `tokio::select!` event-loop thread: once per
//! config-mutating inbound DIDComm message plus ~15 action sites. A mediator
//! redelivery *burst* therefore ran N sequential keyring+file+card writes,
//! blocking input the whole time.
//!
//! # The mechanism
//!
//! This module factors out a small, testable scheduler that the runtime loop
//! drives. It has three pieces of state — **dirty**, **in-flight**, and a
//! debounce **deadline** — and it preserves the single-mutator invariant: the
//! snapshot is taken on the loop thread (the only place `Config` is mutated) and
//! the actual blocking `save` runs on a `spawn_blocking` thread that owns the
//! snapshot.
//!
//! * Mutation sites call [`SaveScheduler::mark_dirty`] instead of saving inline.
//!   The first dirty mark arms a deadline `DEBOUNCE` in the future.
//! * The loop adds one select arm that waits until the deadline
//!   ([`SaveScheduler::wait_deadline`]). When it fires the loop calls
//!   [`SaveScheduler::take_for_save`]; if a save is dirty *and* not already in
//!   flight, that clears the dirty flag, marks in-flight, and returns a
//!   [`PendingSave`] the loop spawns via `spawn_blocking`.
//! * At most **one** save is in flight at a time. Marks that land while a save
//!   runs simply re-set the dirty flag; on completion ([`SaveScheduler::finish`])
//!   the scheduler re-arms a deadline so exactly one more save is scheduled.
//! * Durability-critical points call [`SaveScheduler::flush`] for a synchronous
//!   (awaited, still off-runtime) drain of any pending dirty state.
//!
//! The save *decision* logic (`mark_dirty` / `take_for_save` / `finish`) is pure
//! over the scheduler's own fields and unit-tested in isolation (see the tests
//! at the bottom and the coalescing/flush tests), following the
//! pure-handler + mini-loop style established by `background_dispatch`.
